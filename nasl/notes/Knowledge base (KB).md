Each host is associated to an internal knowlege base, which contains all the information gathered by the tests during the scan. 

the security tests are encouraged to read it and to contribute to it. 

the status of the ports, for instance, is in fact written somewhere in the knowledge base.

basically, there are two functions regarding the knowledge base

get_kb_item(name) function will return the value of the knowledge base item name, it is a anonymous function.

set_kb_item(name: "name", value: "value"), will mark the new item name of value in the knowledge base.

you can not read back an knowledage base item you have added
