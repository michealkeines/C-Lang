The world is large parallel system, Almost every electronic device has a micro processing in it.

Microprocessors have become small, denser and more powerfull over the years, and i guess we have almost reached the smallest scale we could ever make accourding to the Moore's law.

Computer System Operation:

-> One or more CPUs, devices controllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory.

-> Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles.

The Questions we have to answer NO by providing a better Inferface,

-> Does the programmer need to write single program that performs many independent activities?
-> Does every program have to be altered for every piece of hardware?
-> Does a faulty program crash everything?
-> Does every program have access to all hardware?

Operating System Definition?

-> No universally accepted defintion
-> Everthing a vendor ships when you order an Operation System is good aproximation
-> The one program running at all times on the computer is the Kernal, Everything else is either a system progrma or an application program.

Full coordination and protection by,
-> Managing interactions between different users
-> Multiple programns running simulaneously
-> Multiplex and protect Hardware resources like CPU, Memory, IO devices


Would this complexity make sense if there were only one application that you cared about?

It does, because, if our application crashes, we still get debug information instead of a blank screen.
