Functions in C are actually just pointers to a spot in the program where some code exists.

just like we created pointers to structs, strings, array we can point a pointer at a function.

this is usefulluf for passing callbacks to other functions



return_type (*Pointer_name)(arguments);

int test_function(int a, int b);

int (*compare)(int a, int b) = test_function;


we can use typedef to make it aproper variable that could be passed to function

typedef int (*compare)(int a, int b);


int test(int val, compare callback);
