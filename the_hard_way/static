static (file) This keyword is kind of the inverse of extern, and says that the
variable is only used in this .c file and should not be available to other
parts of the program. Keep in mind that static at the file level (as with
THE_AGE here) is different than in other places.

Static int age = 10; // this is accessible within the file where it is declared


static (function) If you declare a variable in a function static, then that
variable acts like a static defined in the file, but it’s only accessible
from that function. It’s a way of creating constant state for a function, but
in reality it’s rarely used in modern C programming because they are hard
to use with threads

int test(int val) {
	static int t = 10; // this will also act like a static defined within a file
	t = val;
	return t;
}
