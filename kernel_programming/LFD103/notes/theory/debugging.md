Debugging has not perfect reciepe, asking the following questions can be good starting poinnt

- is the problem easity reproducible
- is there a reproducer or test that can tigger the bug consistently
- are there any panic or error or debug messages  in the dmesg when the bug was triggered
- is reproducing the problem time sensitive

Kernel Panic

It is an action taken by an operating system upon detecting an internal fatal error from which it cannot safely recover and force the system to do a controlled system hand/reboot due to a detected runtime system malfunction (also known as hard panics)


OOPS are due to the kernel exception handler getting executed including macros such as BUG() which is defined as an invalid instruction each exceptoion has a unique number. some oops are bad enough that the kernel decides to execute the panic handler feature to stop running immediately (also known as soft panic)


```
scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh ./vmlinux < panic_trace.txt
```

Save (cut and paste) the panic trace in the dmesg between the two following lines of text into a .txt file.

```
------------[ cut here ]------------
---[ end trace â€¦. ]---
```

panic traces can be decoded using this bash script


Event Tracing

As you debug and analyze bugs, you might find event tracing useful. You don't have to recompile, and you can enable events on a running system, which is a plus. Root access is necessary to access the /sys/kernel/debug directory and enable events. Please refer to the Event Tracing page in the Linux Kernel Documentation for more details.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/events.html

An example usage is if you are debugging a networking problem, you can enable available events for that area. You can read up on how to use event tracing to get insight into the system. The file /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events lists all the events you can enable. You will see several directories:sched, skb and many others in the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events directory.

You will see a file called enable under each of these directories and in the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events. These directories correspond to kernel areas and trace events they support. These events can be enabled at runtime to get insight into system activity. If you want to enable all skb events:

```
Enable all events:
      cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events
      echo 1 > enable 

Enable the skb events:
      cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/skb
      echo 1 > enable
```

Before you run your reproducer, enable areas of interest one at a time. You can determine areas of interest based on the call trace. Run the reproducer. You can find the event traces in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace.

A few debugging tips:

    Adding additional debug messages (pr_debug or dev_debug) is a good way to gather information on a bug.
    However, avoid adding additional messages and enabling event tracing when debugging a time-sensitive problem, as it can change the timing and could make it harder to reproduce the problem.
