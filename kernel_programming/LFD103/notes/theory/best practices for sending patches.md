A few tips and best practices for sending patches:

    Run scripts/checkpatch.pl before sending the patch. Note that checkpatch.pl might suggest changes that are unnecessary! Use your best judgement when deciding whether it makes sense to make the change checkpatch.pl suggests. The end goal is for the code to be more readable. If checkpatch.pl suggests a change and you think the end result is not more readable, don't make the change. For example, if a line is 81 characters long, but breaking it makes the resulting code look ugly, don't break that line.
    Compile and test your change.
    Document your change and include relevant testing details and results of that testing.
    Signed-off-by should be the last tag.
    As a general rule, don't include change lines in the commit log.
    Remember that good patches get accepted quicker. It is important to understand how to create good patches.
    Copy mailing lists and maintainers/developers suggested by scripts/get_maintainer.pl.
    Be patient and wait for a minimum of one week before requesting for comments. It could take longer than a week during busy periods such as the merge windows.
    Always thank the reviewers for their feedback and address them.
    Don’t hesitate to ask a clarifying question if you don’t understand the comment.
    When working on a patch based on a suggested idea, make sure to give credit using the Suggested-by tag. Other tags used for giving credit are Tested-by, Reported-by.
    Remember that the reviewers help improve code. Don’t take it personally and handle the feedback gracefully. Please don’t do top post when responding to emails. Responses should be inlined.
    Keep in mind that the community doesn’t have any obligation to accept your patch. Patches are pulled, not pushed. Always give a reason for the maintainer to take your patch.
    Be patient and be ready to make changes and working with the reviewers. It could take multiple versions before your patch gets accepted. It is okay to disagree with maintainers and reviewers. Please don't ignore a review because you disagree with it. Present your reasons for disagreeing, along with supporting technical data such as benchmarks and other improvements.
    In general, getting response and comments is a good sign that the community likes the patch and wants to see it improved. Silence is what you want to be concerned about. If you don't hear any response back from the maintainer after a week, feel free to either send the patch again, or send a gentle "ping" - something like "Hi, I know you are busy, but have you found time to look at my patch?"
    Expect to receive comments and feedback at any time during the review process.
    Stay engaged and be ready to fix problems, if any, after the patch gets accepted into linux-next for integration into the mainline. Kernel build and Continuous Integration (CI) bots and rings usually find problems.
    When a patch gets accepted, you will either see an email from the maintainer or an automated patch accepted email with information on which tree it has been applied to, and some estimate on when you can expect to see it in the mainline kernel. Not all maintainers might send an email when the patch gets merged. The patch could stay in linux-next for integration until the next merge window, before it gets into Linus's tree. Unless the patch is an actual fix to a bug in Linus's tree, in which case, it may go directly into his tree.
    Sometimes you need to send multiple related patches. This is useful for grouping, say, to group driver clean up patches for one particular driver into a set, or grouping patches that are part of a new feature into one set. git format-patch -2 -s --cover-letter --thread --subject-prefix="PATCH v3" --to= “name” --cc=” name” will create a threaded patch series that includes the top two commits and generated cover letter template. It is a good practice to send a cover letter when sending a patch series.
    Including patch series version history in the cover letter will help reviewers get a quick snapshot of changes from version to version.
    When a maintainer accepts a patch, the maintainer assumes maintenance responsibility for that patch. As a result, maintainers have decision power on how to manage patch flow into their individual sub-system(s) and they also have individual preferences. Be prepared for maintainer-to-maintainer differences in commit log content and sub-system specific coding styles
