Counting duplicates:

- we can use hashmaps to keep track of all the characters in the strings and to count the number of repeated characters

Valid Anagram:

- we can solve it using normal hashmaps to count the total character and repeated one in both the inputs
- we can also use direct maps as we knw the upper limt of our input, we can use normal arrays to map the input

Two Sum:

- basic algebra, that x + y = target, and we get the y value, which we can use as the key for the hashmap
