step size depends up on the type of the variable that is 

for int the step size is 4 bytes

char step size is 1 byte

by default if we add one to apointer,we move one byte

we cant derefence void pointers directly, we have assign them to type pointer or cast them

this is generaly using funtion parameters to get any pointer  and then cast it as we need
